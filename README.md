# Hybrid-Battery-Feature-Selection

This repository contains a Full Order Model (FOM) and a Reduced Order Model (ROM) for lithium-ion battery modeling, implemented in Matlab. The FOM is also available as a Comsol model. The repository also includes excel files containing the electrochemical parameters needed to run the models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Matlab
- Comsol (only needed for the FOM)
- Excel (for the electrochemical parameters)

### Installing
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Matlab file for the FOM or ROM.
3. Run the model using the provided electrochemical parameters from the excel files.

## Usage
The FOM and ROM can be used to simulate the behavior of lithium-ion batteries under different operating conditions and to analyze the performance of the battery. The Comsol model allows for a more detailed analysis of the battery's electrochemical processes.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository. If you are interested in contributing, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes. Be sure to also update the documentation in the README as necessary.
